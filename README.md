web client

In this task, we wrote  web client for WhatsApp desktop in html and javascript and designed using css.
The WhatsApp desktop consists of 3 parts-
login screen, registration screen and chat screen.

To run the code you have to start running the login.html code and login in using username and password. After connecting properly it will open the chat screen.

If the user is not yet registered he can register on the registration screen and from there it will open the chat screen.
